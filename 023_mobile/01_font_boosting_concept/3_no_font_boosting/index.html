    <h1>try this page on mobile</h1>
    <p>without the meta viewport the mobile, the page will display like in a desktop window (only under 980px), showing small font text, which is not good for mobile</p>
    <p>but, with tho paragraphs, the font is 'boosted' automatically, making it bigger and readable in mobile</p>
    <p><strong>Even thought this page has more than 2 p, the 'font boosting' is disable via CSS</strong></p>
