    <p>There is a shorthand way to use the font property, but first, let's know every part of it before using it:</p>
<h2>
    font family property
    <br>
<h3>
    The font-family CSS property lets you specify a prioritized list of font family names and/or
    generic family names for the selected element. Values are separated by a comma to indicate
    that they are alternatives. The browser will select the first font on the list that is installed on the
    computer or that can be downloaded. Web authors should always add at least one generic
    family in a font-family list, since there's no guarantee that a specific font is installed on
    the computer or can be downloaded. The generic family lets the browser select an
    acceptable fallback font when needed.
