    <p>There is a shorthand way to use the font property, but first, let's know every part of it before using it:</p>
<h2>
    font family property
</h2> 
<p>
    The font-family CSS property lets you specify a <b>prioritized list of font family names and/or
        generic family names for the selected element. Values are separated by a comma to indicate
        that they are alternatives</b>. The browser will select the first font on the list that is installed on the
    computer or that can be downloaded. Web authors should always add at least one generic
    family in a font-family list, since there's no guarantee that a specific font is installed on
    the computer or can be downloaded. The generic family lets the browser select an
    acceptable fallback font when needed.
</p>
    

<h2>
font size property
</h2>
<p>
    <b>vh</b> stands for 1/100 th of the with of the viewport, it's like the windows is divided in 100 pieces.<br>
    This will make the font change sizes when the browser window changes, if the windows increases, the font will increase too and 
    vice versa.<br>
    It is used for Banners that you want to be always visible in the screen.<br>
    This is used for the headers of this page.
</p>
<p>
    <b>rem</b> stands for Root EM (M), which is a relative size of the Root Font Size who is the default font size of the browser.
    1rem is the default size, if the user changed his default settings, the size of the font will change on the page.
    4rem is 4 times the default browser font size (16px) = 64px.
    This is used for <b>accessibility</b>.
</p>
<h2>
    font-weight & font-style Properties
</h2>
<p class="style">
    The font-weight CSS property specifies the weight or boldness of the font. Some fonts are only available in normal and bold. <br>
    The font-style CSS property lets you select italic or oblique faces within a font-family. Italic forms are generally cursive in nature, usually using less horizontal space than their unstyled counterparts, while oblique faces are usually just sloped versions of the regular face. Both italic and oblique faces are simulated by artificially sloping the glyphs of the regular face.
</p>

<h2>font-variant & text-transform</h2>

<p class="variant">
    The font-variant property acts as a shorthand for the longhand properties. You can also set the CSS Level 2 (Revision 1) values of font-variant, (that is, normal or small-caps), by using the font shorthand.  <br> small-caps
</p>

<p class="transform">
    <b>This is not part of the font shorthand</b> <br>
    The text-transform CSS property specifies how to capitalize an element's text. It can be used to make text appear in <b>all-uppercase</b> or <b>all-lowercase</b>, or with each word capitalized. <br> capitalize
</p>


<h2>line-height</h2>
<p class="height">
    <b>The vertical space between lines of texts.</b>The line-height CSS property sets the height of a line box. It's commonly used to set the distance between lines of text. On block-level elements, it specifies the minimum height of line boxes within the element. On non-replaced inline elements, it specifies the height that is used to calculate line box height.
