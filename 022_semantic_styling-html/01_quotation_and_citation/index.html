    <h3>'blockquote' with 'cite' attribute</h3>
    <p>Ted Chiang said
    <blockquote
        cite="https://www.goodreads.com/quotes/7536054-my-message-to-you-is-this-pretend-that-you-have">
        My message to you is this: pretend that you have free will. It's
        essential that you behave as if your decisions matter, even though you
        know they don't. The reality isn't important: what's important is your
        belief, and believing the lie is the only way to avoid a waking coma.
        Civilization now depends on self-deception. Perhaps it always has.
